## 1. Purpose and Vision

### 1.1 Purpose

The **portfolio entity** is the portfolio / project / product /
program registry of the Main X Index — a federated identity index
serving a worldwide public governmental system with millions of users.
It models the unit of work an organisation funds, staffs, and reports
on as **four distinct matchable kinds** of *work item*:

- **Portfolio** — the **umbrella container**: a top-level grouping of
  related initiatives, itself a matchable record;
- **Project**, **Product**, **Program** — distinct matchable record
  types that sit **under** a portfolio (each carries a `portfolio_ref`
  to its parent).

Each kind lives in its **own service table and its own REST
collection**, so a project is never matched against a product. The
entity is delivered as a trio of subprojects that compose into one
capability:

| Subproject | Role |
|---|---|
| [project-portfolio-management-service-with-loco](../project-portfolio-management-service-with-loco/) | Registry service **and** project-management tool — loco.rs CRUD + matching over REST across the four work-item collections; PostgreSQL persistence; operational sub-resources (goals, tasks, issues) and derived views (timeline / burndown) |
| [project-portfolio-management-matcher-rust-crate](../project-portfolio-management-matcher-rust-crate/) | Canonical pairwise matching library — deterministic + probabilistic, kind-gated, embedded by the service |
| [project-portfolio-management-front-end-with-svelte](../project-portfolio-management-front-end-with-svelte/) | Operator UI — SvelteKit SPA over the service's REST API |

The entity has **two faces that share one record**:

- **A matchable identity registry.** It gives an organisation one
  canonical record per work item — portfolio-level deduplication: "is
  this migration project the same initiative the other department
  already chartered?" The **thin** `WorkItem` record (the matcher
  type) is deduplicated and matchable on the attributes that identify a
  work item (name, goal titles, owner-scoped code, sponsoring
  organisation, parent portfolio, timeframe, keywords, identifiers).
  Matching is **within a kind only** (§5.5): two work items of
  different `kind` never match.
- **A project-management tool.** A `WorkItem` also *owns* operational
  sub-resources — goals, tasks, issues — and derived views (timeline /
  Gantt, burndown). This high-volume operational data lives in
  **separate service tables** and is **deliberately excluded** from the
  matcher payload (§5.6); only the thin identity record is matched.

### 1.2 Vision

One canonical record per real-world work item, organised under
portfolios, usable both for portfolio dedup and as the live project
workspace:

- **Registry of work-item identities.** The entity records *which*
  portfolios, projects, products, and programs exist and how they are
  identified — not (for matching purposes) the day-to-day task churn.
  Identifiers (external PM-tool ids such as Jira project keys, Asana
  GIDs, Trello board ids, plus URIs / UUIDs) make it the linkage hub
  between PM tools, sponsoring organisations, and the people who lead
  and staff the work.
- **Explainable matching.** Every match decision returns a
  per-component score breakdown (name, goals, code, owner org, parent
  portfolio, timeframe, keywords, relationships, tags) that an auditor
  can inspect — no black boxes — after a hard **kind gate** that
  returns no-match across collections.
- **Federated by reference.** A work item's lead, assignees, and
  members are **`EntityRef`s** into the person / worker / authentication
  entities; its sponsoring organisation is an `EntityRef` into the
  organization entity; its parent portfolio is a `portfolio_ref`; and
  any goal / task / issue can carry a cross-service link to **any**
  index entity
  ([`agents/share/cross-service-linking.md`](../../agents/share/cross-service-linking.md)).
- **Multinational by design.** `in_language` on every record;
  operator surfaces localize to the locales in
  [`agents/share/locales.md`](../../agents/share/locales.md)
  (roadmap, §15).
- **Audit-grade.** Soft delete, full audit logging, and event
  streaming from the family baseline, suitable for
  government-portfolio information governance.

### 1.3 Non-goals

- **Not** a replacement for full-feature PM suites (Jira, Asana, MS
  Project, Linear). The operational sub-resources cover charter-level
  planning and tracking; deep PM features (custom workflows,
  automation rules, time tracking, sprint ceremonies) stay in the
  source tools and link in via external-id identifiers (§5.5).
- **Not** a finance / budgeting system — no cost ledgers, no
  invoicing. Budget figures, where modelled at all, are descriptive,
  not transactional.
- **Not** a collaboration / discussion store — posts, comments, and
  membership management are **out of scope** (deferred, §15); the
  sub-resources are goals, tasks, and issues only.
- **Not** an authentication / authorisation provider. Sign-on for the
  whole index is the [authentication entity](../../authentication/)
  (passwordless magic-link, cookie session + PASETO v4 public token); this
  entity is a token *verifier* and references user identities by `EntityRef`.
  Auth source of truth (supersedes the RS256-JWT model):
  [`agents/share/authentication-sessions.md`](../../agents/share/authentication-sessions.md).
- **Cross-service links are never a match signal** — a work item that
  *links to* a person or org is not thereby the *same* as another work
  item
  ([`agents/share/cross-service-linking.md` §7](../../agents/share/cross-service-linking.md)).
