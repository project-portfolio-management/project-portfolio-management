//! (`agents/share/rust-tracing-opentelemetry-stack.md`). This crate
//! carried **no** `src/observability` module at all before this change,
//! and is the **fourth and last of the four loco-idiomatic registries**
//! (organization, care-pathway, case, portfolio — `src/controllers/`,
//! not `src/api/rest/`) to carry it: the other three each found exactly
//! one router-construction surface, and that shape is confirmed here
//! too, not assumed (see "What differs from the person-style ports"
//! below) — the last of PRO-H12's seven slices.

//!
//! ## What it installs
//!
//! [`init`] builds one [`Resource`] (`service.name` + `service.version`,
//! plus whatever the SDK's own detectors add) and hangs three things off it:
//!
//! 1. a `tracing-subscriber` **fmt layer** in the format loco's own config
//!    asks for, filtered by loco's own [`EnvFilter`] policy (so `RUST_LOG`
//!    and the `logger:` config block keep working exactly as before);
//! 2. a [`tracing_opentelemetry`] **bridge layer** over an OTLP/gRPC
//!    [`SdkTracerProvider`], so every `tracing` span becomes an exported
//!    `OTel` span;
//! 3. an OTLP/gRPC [`SdkMeterProvider`] set as the global meter provider,
//!    read periodically, feeding [`http_metrics`].
//!
//! Local logs and remote export are **both** active — not either/or.
//!
//! ## Configuration
//!
//! | Variable | Default | Effect |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `RUST_LOG` | loco's whitelist at the configured level | `EnvFilter` directive |
//! | `OTLP_SERVICE_NAME` | `project-portfolio-management-service` | `service.name` resource attribute |
//! | `OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `http://localhost:4317` | OTLP/gRPC collector endpoint |
//!
//! These three variables are **deliberately not
//! `PROJECT_PORTFOLIO_MANAGEMENT_`-prefixed**, matching every other
//! crate that carries this pipeline and
//! `agents/share/rust-tracing-opentelemetry-stack.md`'s "Configuration"
//! table verbatim — unlike the per-service `<ENTITY>_REQUIRE_AUTH`
//! activation-flag convention, OTLP export has no such flag (see below)
//! and the shared doc fixes one family-wide variable name rather than a
//! `<ENTITY>_`-prefixed one per crate.
//!
//! The defaults are the shared doc's, which means export is **on by
//! default** — there is no `<ENTITY>_…`-style activation flag, deliberately.
//! Setting `OTLP_ENDPOINT` to the **empty string** disables export and
//! leaves only local logging; that is the one escape hatch, and it is a
//! value of the documented variable rather than a new one.
//!
//! `RUST_LOG` is **not** only a log-verbosity knob once the bridge layer is
//! installed: the filter sits above both sinks, so it also decides what is
//! exported. Loco's default is a module whitelist, which keeps the trace
//! stream to this service's own spans; a blanket `RUST_LOG=trace` would ship
//! every internal `h2` / `hyper` / `sqlx` span to the collector as well.
//! That is a volume problem, not a correctness one, but it is worth knowing
//! before turning the dial during an incident.
//!
//! ## Why booting without a collector is safe
//!
//! Verified against the SDK version pinned here, not assumed:
//!
//! - the tonic channel is built with `connect_lazy()`, so **nothing dials
//!   the collector during boot** — [`build_span_exporter`] cannot block or
//!   fail on an unreachable endpoint;
//! - the batch span processor and the periodic metric reader each own a
//!   dedicated OS thread, so a stalled export never occupies a Tokio worker;
//! - a full span queue **drops**, it does not block the emitting request.
//!
//! A service with no collector therefore starts, serves, and shuts down
//! identically — it just logs an export error every batch interval **while
//! it is actually producing spans**, which is the honest signal for
//! "someone configured an endpoint that is not there".
//!
//! ## What differs from the person-style ports
//!
//! person/worker/event/course/place/thing each carry **two**
//! router-construction surfaces (a loco-native one plus a hand-rolled
//! `create_router` used only by their own DB-gated integration tests), so
//! [`trace_mw`] is layered on both. This crate (loco-idiomatic,
//! `src/controllers/`) has exactly **one** — `App::routes` +
//! `App::after_routes` in `src/app.rs` — confirmed by grepping `src/` and
//! `tests/` for a second `Router::new()`/`create_router`: the one hit
//! (`src/auth.rs`) is a unit test for the auth middleware itself, not an
//! app-level router, and the request-level test suites boot the real
//! `App` via loco's own testing harness rather than a second hand-rolled
//! router. `trace_mw` is therefore layered once, in `after_routes`, same
//! as organization's, care-pathway's, and case's. This crate also
//! declares no `tonic` dependency of its own (no gRPC stub —
//! `agents/share/overview.md`'s capability matrix), so the in-process
//! OTLP collector tests below need no `package = "…"` rename, exactly as
//! the other three loco-idiomatic ports did not. Unlike care-pathway and
//! case, this crate carries no IEC 62304 SOUP register, so this port
//! needed no `compliance/soup.tsv` bookkeeping step.
