//! Row-level integrity hashing over the `cases` table.
//!
//! The audit chain ([`super::audit_chain`]) proves the **trail** was not
//! rewritten. It says nothing about the entity rows themselves: an
//! attacker with SQL access could edit a stored case and, as long as
//! they wrote no audit row, the chain would still verify. That gap was
//! stated plainly in the entity spec's honest limits; this module closes
//! it.
//!
//! Each `cases` row carries a `content_hash` — a SHA-256 over its
//! own content and lifecycle state — recomputed on **every** write. A
//! change made outside the service (or a bug that writes a row without
//! rehashing) is then detectable by recomputation.
//!
//! ## Not a chain
//!
//! Unlike `audit_logs`, entity rows are *mutable by design*: an update
//! replaces the payload. So this is a per-row content hash, not a chain —
//! it detects **out-of-band modification**, not deletion or reordering. A
//! row deleted directly in SQL leaves no trace here; the audit chain is
//! what covers that, because a legitimate delete writes an audit row and
//! an illegitimate one breaks the chain. The two controls are
//! complementary, and neither subsumes the other.
//!
//! ## What is hashed
//!
//! `pid`, `name`, the `data` payload, `active`, and `deleted_at` — the
//! record's content and its lifecycle state.
//!
//! **`created_at` / `updated_at` are excluded on purpose.** They are set
//! by the ORM and the database rather than by this code, so binding them
//! would make the digest depend on values the writer does not control,
//! producing false mismatches. The cost is honest and small: an attacker
//! who alters only a timestamp is not detected here. Anything that
//! changes what the record *says* is.
//!
//! Reproducibility follows the same two rules as the audit chain: time is
//! hashed as epoch microseconds (so writers must truncate before storing),
//! and JSON is hashed as `serde_json`'s serialization, whose `BTreeMap`
//! key order matches what a JSONB round-trip returns.
//! ## Computed here, not in the database
//!
//! Deliberately, and not for lack of database support: Postgres can
//! compute both digests (`sha256()` is core, `pgcrypto` does
//! `sha3-256`). A database-side digest would be recomputed by *any*
//! write, including a raw SQL edit by an attacker — the mechanism meant
//! to witness the change would be driven by the change itself, which is
//! the defect that removed the database audit triggers. See
//! `spec/12-compliance.md` §12.4z, "Where the digests are computed".
