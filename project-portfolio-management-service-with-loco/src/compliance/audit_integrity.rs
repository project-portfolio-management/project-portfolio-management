//! Keyed integrity for `audit_logs` rows.
//!
//! Each audit row carries an HMAC over a pre-image built from the fields
//! that say *what happened, to what, by whom, and when*. Editing any of
//! them without the key invalidates the MAC.
//!
//! ## What this detects, and what it does not
//!
//! **Detects:** an audit row whose content was altered — the action verb
//! changed, the actor rewritten, the snapshot edited, the timestamp
//! moved. That is the common shape of covering one's tracks: leave the
//! row, change what it says.
//!
//! **Does not detect:** a row **deleted wholesale**, or rows reordered.
//! Nothing in a row can attest to its own continued existence. Catching
//! deletion needs a hash chain linking each row to its predecessor, plus
//! external-witness checkpoints so truncating the tail is visible — the
//! control the person, worker, care-pathway, and case services carry and
//! this one does not yet.
//!
//! That limit is stated here rather than left implicit, because a MAC on
//! every row looks like complete tamper-evidence and is not. It raises
//! the cost of a silent edit to holding the key; it does nothing about
//! `DELETE`.
//!
//! ## Why `created_at` is set explicitly
//!
//! The timestamp is part of the pre-image, so it has to be known before
//! the insert. Letting the database default it would mean writing the row
//! and then stamping the MAC in a second statement — a window in which
//! the row exists unprotected, and a second failure mode if the stamp
//! never lands.
