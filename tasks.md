# Tasks: ideas from Leantime

Derived from [plan.md](plan.md) (research 2026-10-02). IDs are `LT-n` so they
do not collide with the numbered build-out in
[spec/13-tasks.md](spec/13-tasks.md); promote an item there (as `T-29…`) when
it is scheduled. Sizes: S ≈ a day, M ≈ a few days, L ≈ a week+. A box is ticked
only when an automated test or a clearly described manual check confirms the
acceptance criterion.

Convention carried over from T-28: absent evidence is `null` with a reason,
never zero; new endpoints are pinned in `src/openapi.rs`; every write is
audited; people stay references.

- [x] **LT-1 (L) — Strategy canvases.** **Service landed 2026-10-02**
  (`src/canvas.rs`, `src/controllers/canvas.rs`, migration
  `m20261002_000001_canvases`, 7 unit + 4 DB-gated request tests, all passing
  against Postgres). **Not built:** the front-end pages, and OpenAPI entries
  (the six routes are on the `KNOWN_UNDOCUMENTED` register in
  `src/openapi.rs`, to be documented). The `risk` and `goal` templates are
  this service's own box sets, not a copy of Leantime's. A generic canvas engine: a
  `canvases` table (plan-scoped or free-standing, `template` key) and
  `canvas_items` (`box` key, text, optional owner ref, `position`), with
  built-in templates Lean, Business Model, SWOT, risk, empathy map, logic
  model and goal canvas. Template = ordered box list; adding a canvas type is
  data, not a migration. A canvas item may be **promoted** to an idea, a risk
  or an objective (reusing the existing convert paths).
  **Acceptance:** each built-in template round-trips; an unknown `box` for a
  template is refused 422; promoting an item writes the target record and an
  audit row naming the source item; deleting a canvas soft-deletes its items.
  *Front-end:* `/canvases` and `/plans/[pid]/canvases`, English-first.

- [ ] **LT-2 (M) — Plan templates (blueprints).** `POST
  /api/plans/{pid}/save-as-template` and `POST /api/plans/from-template/{tpl}`.
  A template captures the plan's subtree shape, tasks (without assignees or
  dates), milestones as **offsets** from a start date, and the workflow
  reference. Instantiating takes a start date and rewrites offsets to dates.
  **Acceptance:** an instantiated tree has the template's shape with fresh
  pids; no person reference is copied; milestone dates equal start + offset;
  the template itself is unaffected by later edits to the source plan; every
  created plan goes through `create_and_emit` (events + audit not bypassed).
  *Depends on:* nothing; shares clone logic with T-8's import pipeline.

- [ ] **LT-3 (M) — "My work" personal task view.** **Priority 1 — about half
  the users are individual workers (owner, 2026-10-02).** Default landing page
  for a caller whose `view` attribute is not a PMO persona. `GET /api/me/tasks`
  bucketed `overdue / today / this_week / later / undated` in the **caller's**
  timezone, plus a quick-add (`POST /api/plans/{pid}/tasks` already exists;
  the front-end adds a one-line form). Assigned-to-me by `actor_ref` from the
  token `sub`.
  **Acceptance:** a task due 23:30 local appears under `today` for that user
  and `today` or `this_week` correctly for another timezone (pinned by a test
  with two zones); a user with no assignments gets empty buckets, not an
  error; unreadable plans' tasks are omitted, not shown masked.
  *Front-end:* `/me`, one focus list, no chrome. Pairs with LT-9.

- [x] **LT-4 (M) — Comments and reactions.** **Service landed 2026-10-02**
  (`src/discussion.rs`, `src/controllers/discussion.rs`, migration
  `m20261002_000002_comments_reactions`, 6 unit + 3 DB-gated request tests).
  **Deviation:** one generic surface (`/api/comments`, `/api/reactions` with
  `subject_kind` + `subject_pid`) instead of per-entity paths, so a new subject
  kind is code, not routes. **Not built:** front-end; OpenAPI entries (on the
  `KNOWN_UNDOCUMENTED` register); the author-only rule is proven by a unit
  test, not an end-to-end token test (request tests run with auth off).
  Notifications address an earlier commenter as `person:<sub>` only when the
  `sub` is a UUID — an assumption to confirm with the auth service.
  *Priority 2 (workers discuss their own tasks daily).* `comments` and `reactions`
  tables keyed `(subject_kind, subject_pid)`; endpoints under
  `/api/{subject}/{pid}/comments` and `/reactions`. Subject kinds: plan, task,
  risk, proposal, idea, canvas item. Reactions are a small closed set,
  one per `(subject, user, kind)`. A comment emits a notification to the
  subject's owner and prior commenters.
  **Acceptance:** a second identical reaction is idempotent (no duplicate
  row); a comment on a plan the caller cannot read is 403/404 like the plan
  itself; edit and delete are the author's, delete is a soft delete, and the
  edit history is kept; a notification fires once per recipient.
  *Reconcile with* the deferred `posts / comments` item in the API spec §9.

- [ ] **LT-5 (M) — File attachments.** `attachments` table
  (`subject_kind`, `subject_pid`, `artifact_id`, `filename`, `content_type`,
  `bytes`, `sha256`, `uploaded_by`) over the **artifact store from T-8 §7**.
  Upload, list, download, soft-delete; size and content-type allow-list.
  **Acceptance:** an upload outside the allow-list or over the cap is refused
  before it is stored; the stored `sha256` matches the bytes; a download is
  re-authorised against the *subject's* ABAC, not just the attachment's;
  UTF-8 filenames survive upload and download (Leantime shipped a bug here).
  *Blocked on:* T-8 step 1–2 (artifact store). Gate-review and risk evidence
  are the first consumers.

- [ ] **LT-6 (M) — Per-user webhooks and chat sinks.** Extend T-28m
  (`src/webhooks.rs`): a user registers their own destination for **their**
  notifications; and a `format` option renders the payload for Slack,
  Mattermost, Discord or Telegram instead of the family envelope.
  **Acceptance:** a personal webhook receives only that user's notifications;
  the signature scheme is unchanged (HMAC over the exact body sent); a
  per-format golden test pins each renderer; a destination that fails is
  retried and logged like a deployment webhook and never blocks the
  notification write; no secret is returned by any read endpoint.

- [ ] **LT-7 (S) — iCalendar feed.** `GET /api/calendar.ics?token=…`: milestones,
  sprint start/end, and task due dates the caller may read, as VEVENTs with
  stable `UID`s, so a calendar app updates instead of duplicating.
  Per-user revocable feed token (not the session token).
  **Acceptance:** the feed validates as RFC 5545; `UID`s are stable across
  two fetches; a revoked token returns 401; an item the caller cannot read is
  absent; all-day versus timed values use the correct `VALUE=DATE`.

- [ ] **LT-8 (M) — Wiki / documents** — **decide first.** Options:
  (a) build `pages` + `page_versions` with templates; (b) a `links` field that
  points plans at an external doc system; (c) refuse. Recommendation: **(b)**
  first. A registry that stores prose competes with the organisation's real
  docs tool, and links are cheap. Revisit (a) only if LT-1/LT-4 usage shows
  people pasting long text into descriptions.
  **Acceptance (for (b)):** a plan carries typed links (`kind`, `url`, label);
  non-`http(s)` schemes are refused; links are shown, never fetched
  server-side.

- [ ] **LT-9 (S) — Timezone audit.** Verify every stored timestamp is UTC
  (`timestamptz`) and that every *date bucket* (due today, overdue, sprint
  day, burndown day) is computed in an explicit zone, not the server's.
  Write down the doctrine in the spec and add a test that runs the date-bucket
  code under a non-UTC `TZ`.
  **Acceptance:** a short findings list (clean or fixed, per site); a test
  that fails if a bucket changes with the process `TZ`; the doctrine stated in
  `spec/07-non-functional-requirements.md`.
  *Why:* Leantime's 3.10.1 fixed timestamps stored in viewer-local time,
  midnight due-date buckets and "Invalid DateTime" in the calendar.

- [ ] **LT-10 (S) — Task relations.** `task_relations` (`from`, `kind` ∈
  `related | duplicates | blocks`, `to`); `blocks` reuses dependency cycle
  refusal. Shown on the task detail.
  **Acceptance:** self-relations and exact duplicates are refused; a `blocks`
  cycle is refused; deleting a task soft-deletes its relations; a relation to
  a task in an unreadable plan is hidden from the reader.

- [ ] **LT-11 (M) — Timesheet views and approval.** On the existing
  `time_entries`: `GET /api/timesheets?person=&week=` (a week grid by day and
  plan), `POST …/submit` and `…/approve|reject` per person-week, billable
  roll-up per plan. Approved weeks are locked against edit.
  **Acceptance:** totals equal the sum of entries (no rounding drift,
  integer minutes); an edit to an approved week is refused 409; a week with no
  entries reports `null` hours with a reason, not zero; billable and
  non-billable never merge into one number without both being shown.

- [ ] **LT-12 (M) — Neurodivergent-friendly UX pass.** **Priority 1, built
  alongside LT-3, not after it.** Audit the front-end
  against Leantime's stated goal: plain-language labels, one primary action
  per screen, predictable reading order, `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured,
  contrast at WCAG AA, a dyslexia-friendly font option, and a per-user
  "simple mode" that hides advanced panels. Extends T-28k's Playwright audit.
  **Acceptance:** an axe-core run over the 35 audited routes with zero
  serious/critical violations; reduced-motion disables the tour and splash
  animation; simple mode persists per user (reusing `saved_views` storage)
  and does not remove any capability, only its prominence.
  *Scope settled:* workers are about half the users, so simple mode is the
  default for a non-PMO persona and an opt-in toggle for everyone else.
  Success is measured on the worker path: a first-time worker reaches "what
  do I do today?" in one click from sign-in (a Playwright check on `/me`).
