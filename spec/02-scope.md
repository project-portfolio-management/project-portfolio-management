## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In scope — entity level

This spec owns the **cross-subproject contract**:

- Composition: front-end → service REST API → embedded matcher.
- The DTO contract: the API request/response body for the **thin
  matchable record** **is**
  `project_portfolio_management_matcher::Plan`, stored verbatim as JSONB
  (§5). There is no separate service model and no adapter (exactly the
  care-pathway posture).
- **The optional `kind` label.** Portfolio, Project, Product, Program,
  Practice, Process, Purpose, Pathway, Proposal are the values of an
  **optional** `PlanKind` label — one recursive `plans` table, one REST
  collection (`/api/plans`) — used for description / display / grouping,
  **not** as a discriminator and **not** a match gate: matching is
  **kind-agnostic** (§5.5 / §6.3). Any plan may **contain** any other
  plan via `parent_ref` (a recursive tree); a `parent_ref` that points a
  plan at itself or at one of its descendants is rejected `422`.
- **The matchable/operational partition** (§5.6): the thin `Plan`
  matcher type vs the high-volume sub-resources (tasks, issues) that
  live in their own service tables and never enter the matcher payload.
  `Goal` is the one sub-resource that is **also** part of the payload
  (goal titles feed matching).
- The service ↔ front-end wire contract: raw loco JSON (no envelope),
  TypeScript type mirroring (§5.7).
- Shared invariants that more than one subproject must uphold (§5.8).
- The family integrations this entity adopts wholesale: cross-service
  entity linking
  ([`agents/share/cross-service-linking.md`](../../agents/share/cross-service-linking.md))
  and bulk import / export
  ([`agents/share/bulk-import-export.md`](../../agents/share/bulk-import-export.md)).
- Entity-wide goals: government-portfolio scale, multi-locale,
  auditability, technology-compliance posture (§7, §12).

### 2.2 In scope — per subproject

**project-portfolio-management-service-with-loco** owns:

- Plan CRUD with soft delete (`deleted_at`) over the thin matchable
  record on the single `/api/plans` collection.
- The operational sub-resource CRUD: goals, tasks, issues — each a child
  resource of a plan, keyed by `parent_pid`, in its own Postgres table
  (§10).
- Derived views: timeline / Gantt (goals-with-`target_date` milestones +
  task date ranges) and burndown (remaining-vs-estimate over time from
  task snapshots) — §6.4.
- `POST …/match` (rank an explicit candidate set, no persistence) and
  `POST …/check-duplicates` (match a query against stored plans),
  real-time duplicate detection on create (`409`), record merge (any two
  plans), ILIKE name search — all kind-agnostic across the one
  collection.
- Audit log + event streaming, PASETO v4 public token verification,
  cross-service links, bulk import / export, OpenAPI / Swagger.
- One `plans` table: `pid` + denormalised `name` + the full `Plan` JSONB
  `data` + a nullable denormalised `parent_pid` column; plus the
  sub-resource and family-baseline tables (§10).
- loco.rs app structure, migrations, configuration.

**project-portfolio-management-matcher-rust-crate** owns:

- Pure-library pairwise comparison: kind-agnostic deterministic
  short-circuits (shared deterministic-scheme identifier, same owner-org
  + code, `same_as` URL overlap) + weighted probabilistic scoring (name,
  goals, code, owner org, parent plan, timeframe, keywords,
  relationships, tags) with per-component breakdown.
- The `Plan` domain type, its optional `PlanKind` label, and the
  supporting enums — the entity's canonical DTO — **including the `Goal`
  shape** (goals are part of the matchable payload; their titles are a
  match signal).
- Normalisation (`fold`, code, set folding), Soundex bonus,
  date-proximity scoring, config presets (`strict` / `default` /
  `lenient`).

**project-portfolio-management-front-end-with-svelte** owns:

- Operator routes for the one plans collection — list (`/plans`), create
  (`/plans/new`), detail + delete + check-duplicates (`/plans/[pid]`),
  edit (`/plans/[pid]/edit`), and the sub-resource workspaces (goals /
  tasks / issues, plus timeline + burndown views) — route detail in
  §9.3.
- A plan detail that rolls up its child plans (via `parent_ref`).
- Its own copy of API types, client, and form primitives (drift between
  front-ends is accepted — repo decision 2026-06-02).

### 2.3 Out of scope (today) — MVP deferrals

The entity is **spec-only; no code exists yet** (§14). The first
buildable slice is CRUD + matching over the thin record on the one
plans collection plus the core sub-resources; explicitly deferred,
tracked in §13 / §15 and the crate specs' §13:

- Deep PM features mirrored from source tools (custom workflows,
  automation, sprint ceremonies, time tracking).
- **Posts, comments, and membership** sub-resources (the plan-family
  lineage had them; this entity ships goals / tasks / issues only —
  collaboration threads and membership management are a roadmap item,
  §15).
- Tantivy full-text search over the JSONB payload + the front-end search
  box (ILIKE name search ships first).
- Durable event bus (the MVP ships an in-memory stream, same shape as
  the sibling services; the durable bus is the family roadmap item —
  [`agents/share/event-bus.md`](../../agents/share/event-bus.md)).
- The cross-service link **aggregator** (`link-graph-service`); the
  portfolio service ships the **write-side** `entity_links` + `linked` /
  `unlinked` events only (§9.5).
- Privacy masking / GDPR export beyond the audit posture in §12 (lead /
  assignee / person references are personal data; full masking is
  re-assessed there).
- gRPC, Parquet import (export-only first), terminology / IANA registry
  existence checks.
