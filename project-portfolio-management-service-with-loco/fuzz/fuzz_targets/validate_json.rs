//! FUZZ-2 target: the real request path into payload validation.
//!
//! `POST /api/plans` deserializes an attacker-supplied body into
//! `project_portfolio_management_matcher::Plan` and runs `validation::problems` over it, so this
//! target drives exactly that: arbitrary bytes → `serde_json` → the
//! validator. Coverage-guided search learns the JSON shape, which is what
//! makes the deep fields reachable at all.
//!
//! Invariants:
//!
//! - **never-panic** — the validator runs before anything is stored, on
//!   input nobody here controls;
//! - **deterministic** — the same payload validates to the same problems,
//!   so a `422` body cannot depend on allocation order or iteration
//!   chance;
//! - **bounded report** (SEC-M8) — the number of problems has a ceiling
//!   that does not grow with the size of the payload. Without it, ten
//!   thousand blank entries produced ten thousand problem strings, and a
//!   small request bought a large response.
