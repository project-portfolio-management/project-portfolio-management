## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- 2026-07-18 — **Subproject renamed**: `portfolio` →
  `project-portfolio-management` (directory, crate/package name, lib
  ident, env-var prefix `PORTFOLIO_*` → `PROJECT_PORTFOLIO_MANAGEMENT_*`,
  database names). The **domain language is unchanged**: the work-item
  kinds (portfolio / project / product / program), the `work_items`
  table, the API routes, and the matcher's `WorkItem` type keep their
  names — the rename repositions the *subproject* as a project
  portfolio management (PPM) product; see the feature roadmap in
  `../spec/15-roadmap.md`.


### Added — cargo-fuzz harness (SEC-I2)

- A `fuzz/` [`cargo-fuzz`](https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/) crate adopting
  the person-matcher reference scaffolding, with two coverage-guided
  libFuzzer targets: `match_work_items` (deserialize a JSON `[work_item_a, work_item_b]` tuple →
  `MatchingEngine::match_work_items`; finite score in `[0,1]`, both orders) and
  `normalize` (the pure `normalize` free functions — fold / code / URL / fold-set / ISO date — over arbitrary
  UTF-8, never-panic). Two targets rather than the reference three because
  this crate exposes its similarity primitives only through the engine (the
  `scoring` module publishes no string-similarity functions). Run on nightly:
  `cargo +nightly fuzz run <target>` (see `fuzz/README.md`). The `fuzz/` crate
  is standalone (not a workspace member), so it never affects the crate’s
  normal stable build/test/clippy. Verified: `cargo +nightly fuzz build`
  compiles both targets and short campaigns run clean (millions of execs, no
  panics).

### Added

- **SEC-M6 — property-based tests.** Added `proptest` (dev-dependency) and
  `tests/property_tests.rs`, proving the matcher and its pure helpers are
  well-behaved on arbitrary input rather than only hand-picked examples:
  - `score_is_finite_and_bounded` — the engine never panics and every
    `score` is a real number in `[0.0, 1.0]` (never `NaN`).
  - `matching_is_symmetric_same_kind` — `match_work_items(a, b)` equals
    `match_work_items(b, a)` in score, `is_match`, and confidence for
    same-kind records.
  - `kind_gate_blocks_all_cross_kind_pairs` — the **kind gate**: any pair of
    different `kind` always scores `0.0`, never matches, and sets
    `kind_gate_blocked` with every component `None`.
  - `identical_clone_matches_itself` — reflexivity: a clone of any
    well-formed record clears the threshold (`is_match`).
  - `pure_helpers_never_panic` / `iso_date_never_overflows` — `fold`,
    `code`, `url`, `fold_set`, `iso_date_to_days`, and `soundex` never panic
    on arbitrary strings; `iso_date_to_days` never overflows on adversarial
    long-year date strings (guards the SEC-M4 fix).

  Tests + dev-dependency only — no weights, thresholds, or matching
  behaviour changed.

### Security

- **SEC-M2 — a bare root `same_as` URL no longer forces a deterministic
  match.** `normalize::url("/")` returns `"/"` (non-empty by design), so
  two different work items sharing only `same_as=["/"]` short-circuited to
  `1.0`. The `R-2` `same_as` overlap in `src/matcher.rs` now skips a value
  that is empty-after-normalization or a bare `"/"` root, so such a
  placeholder is not treated as identity evidence. Added the
  `trivial_root_same_as_does_not_short_circuit` test (with a positive
  control that a real shared URL still matches). No weights, thresholds, or
  probabilistic behaviour changed.

### Fixed

- **Security (SEC-M4): year bound in `normalize::iso_date_to_days`.** The
  year was parsed as an unbounded `i64`, so a crafted date such as
  `"99999999999999-01-01"` overflowed the `era * 146_097` term in
  `days_from_civil` (panic in debug, wrap in release) when the timeframe
  component parsed an attacker-supplied `start_date` / `target_date`. The
  year is now bounded to the ISO-8601 `0..=9999` range; out-of-range years
  return `None` (treated as an absent date). Regression test
  `iso_date_year_is_bounded_and_never_overflows`. Upholds the crate's
  "no panic in library code" rule.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Inaugural release.** Specification + doc-set **and the implemented
  crate** for pairwise work-item (Portfolio / Project / Product /
  Program) record matching, copy-adapted from the plan-matcher /
  care-pathway-matcher / case-matcher template. `spec/index.md` is the
  single source of truth. The crate builds and is fully tested
  (55 unit + 10 integration + 7 doctests; `clippy --all-targets
  --all-features -- -D warnings` clean; `cargo fmt` clean; zero
  `#[allow]`). Modules: `work_item`, `matcher`, `scoring`, `config`,
  `normalize` (incl. `url` + ISO-date `iso_date_to_days`), `phonetic`,
  `error`; plus a `main.rs` demo binary. `MatchBreakdown` carries a
  `kind_gate_blocked` flag alongside `deterministic_match`.
  - Domain model: `WorkItem` (kind / name / alternate_names / code /
    owner_org_id / owner_org_name / lead_ref / portfolio_ref / status /
    goals / start_date / target_date / keywords / tags / identifiers /
    sameAs / in_language / relationships), `WorkItemKind` (closed set —
    Portfolio / Project / Product / Program, no `Custom`), `Goal` /
    `GoalStatus`, `WorkItemStatus`, `WorkItemIdentifier` /
    `IdentifierScheme`, `WorkItemRelationship` / `RelationKind`. The
    crate's `WorkItem` type is the API DTO + persisted JSONB payload +
    match input (no adapter).
  - **Kind gate (R-GATE)**: `A.kind != B.kind` short-circuits to `0.0`
    before every other rule — matching is within-kind only (replaces the
    ancestor's `plan_type` weighted component).
  - **Deterministic short-circuits**: R-0 globally-unique identifiers
    (URI, UUID, Jira project key, Asana GID, Trello board id, MS Project
    id, GitHub project id, Linear id); R-1 same-owner code; R-2
    `same_as` URL overlap. Owner-scoped (`Code`/`LocalId`) and `Custom`
    never short-circuit.
  - **Probabilistic components**: name 0.30 (Jaro-Winkler + Soundex
    bonus), goals 0.15 (Jaccard over folded goal titles), code 0.15
    (owner-scoped), owner org 0.10 (case-folded exact), portfolio 0.08
    (same parent `portfolio_ref`, child kinds), timeframe 0.07 (date
    proximity, Gaussian decay), keywords 0.05 (Jaccard), relationships
    0.05 (typed-set Jaccard over `(relation, work_item_id)` pairs), tags
    0.05 (set Jaccard); renormalised over present components.
  - Normalisation: `fold`, `code` (alphanumeric-only), `fold_set`.
  - Classification: `High` ≥ 0.95, `Medium` ≥ 0.70, else `Low`; default
    threshold 0.85 (`strict()` 0.95, `lenient()` 0.70).
