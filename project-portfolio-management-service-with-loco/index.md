# Portfolio Service — documentation index

A loco.rs registry of work-item records — and a project-management tool:
CRUD + matching (embedding the canonical project-portfolio-management-matcher) across the
**four matchable kinds** (Portfolio / Project / Product / Program), plus
operational sub-resources (goals, tasks, issues) and derived timeline /
burndown views.

> **Implemented (MVP, v0.1.0).** The crate exists and builds (`src/`,
> seven migrations); the remaining deferrals live in the work queue at
> [spec §13](./spec/index.md).

## Worked flow

`{collection}` is one of `portfolios` / `projects` / `products` /
`programs` — each with the identical shape below.

```

The `WorkItem` body shape is the `project-portfolio-management-matcher` type (kind, name,
code, owner org, parent `portfolio_ref`, goals, dates, keywords, tags,
relationships, identifiers, sameAs). The four kinds — Portfolio / Project
/ Product / Program — are **distinct collections and tables**, and
**matching is within a collection only** (the matcher's R-GATE makes a
project never match a product). Projects / Products / Programs carry a
`portfolio_ref` to their parent portfolio. The high-volume operational
data — tasks, issues — lives in **separate tables** keyed by the parent
`(kind, pid)` and is **never** fed to the matcher (the partition rule);
only the thin identity payload is matched, with goal **titles** bridging
in via `data.goals[]`.

A create/update payload is validated (blank `name`, UUID / PM-tool-id /
URI identifier shapes, blank goal titles, BCP-47 `in_language`, child-kind
`portfolio_ref`) and returns `422` with every problem in one body. A
real-time create duplicate returns `409 Conflict` with the candidate
matches. Each create/update/delete/merge (work item and sub-resource)
writes an `audit_logs` row, publishes an event, and bumps the matching
per-collection Prometheus counter.

Auth is optional per route by default: send `Authorization: Bearer
<paseto>` — a short-lived PASETO v4.public token minted by the
[authentication-service](../../authentication/authentication-service-with-loco)
and verified offline against its published Ed25519 key (front-ends use a
BFF + cookie session, so the browser holds no token). `whoami` echoes the
verified claims (`401` without one), while every other handler stamps the
token `sub` as the audit `actor`. Leads, assignees, and owners are user /
org identities. Flip `PROJECT_PORTFOLIO_MANAGEMENT_REQUIRE_AUTH=1` to require that token on
every `/api/*` route (`/metrics.prom`, `/api-docs/openapi.json`,
`/swagger-ui`, `/_health`, `/_ping` stay public). Source of truth:
