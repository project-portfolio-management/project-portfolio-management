## 18. Change Control

Material changes to this spec — the canonical domain model (§5), the
optional `PlanKind` label + kind-agnostic matching (§5.2 / §5.5), the
matchable/operational partition (§5.6), shared invariants (§5.8), the
API surface (§9), compliance scope (§12) — MUST land in the same commit
as the corresponding code change, with the corresponding test change
(three-part PR). Until the trio is scaffolded (§13 T-1), a "code
change" may be the scaffold itself; the discipline begins with the
first crate.

Authority boundaries (restated from [`index.md`](index.md)):

- **§5 is canonical.** This entity spec owns the recursive `Plan`
  domain model, its optional `kind` label, kind-agnostic matching, and
  the sub-resource partition. The matcher and service crate specs
  **reference** §5; a change to the model is a change here first,
  mirrored into the crates in the same cycle.
- **Crate internals** — the crate spec wins; mirror material changes
  here only when they touch the integration contract.
- **Integration contract** (the thin DTO shape on the wire, JSONB
  persistence of the matcher type, kind-agnostic matching, the one
  `/api/plans` endpoint inventory the front-end consumes, shared
  invariants, the matchable/operational partition) — this spec wins; a
  crate change that breaks it is a bug or a deliberate, three-spec
  change.

A change to `project_portfolio_management_matcher::Plan` (the thin
record, incl. the optional `PlanKind` label and `Goal`) is
automatically a change to the wire format and the stored payload: it
MUST update the matcher spec, this spec's §5, the front-end's
`types.ts`, and CHANGELOGs in the same change cycle. Adding or removing
a `PlanKind` label variant is a matcher-crate + `types.ts` change only
— it is now a descriptive label, so it adds or drops **no** service
table and **no** REST collection (every plan lives in the one `plans`
table and `/api/plans` collection). The operational sub-resource shapes
(`Task`, `Issue`) have **no** matcher counterpart and are governed by
the service crate spec; a change to them updates the service spec, this
spec's §5.7 / §6.4 / §9.2 / §10.1, and the front-end types together.

The adopted family designs
([cross-service-linking.md](../../agents/share/cross-service-linking.md),
[bulk-import-export.md](../../agents/share/bulk-import-export.md)) are
the source of truth for their own contracts; this spec restates only
the portfolio-specific bits (§9.5, §9.6, §10.4) and tracks the rest by
reference — a change to those shared docs flows in without re-stating
their canonical tables here.

Bullet what changed, not how: every spec edit should be a diff a
reviewer can read in isolation. Keep stylistic re-flows out of
behavioural diffs.
