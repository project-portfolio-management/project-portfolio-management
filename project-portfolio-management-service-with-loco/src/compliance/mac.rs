//! Keyed integrity: this crate's binding to the shared
//! [`integrity_mac`] crate.
//!
//! The cryptography, key sourcing, HKDF domain separation, zeroization,
//! and placeholder refusal all live in `integrity/integrity-mac-rust-crate`
//! — one audited implementation rather than one copy per service. See
//! that crate's module docs for what the MAC defends against and why the
//! separation is per (service, domain).
//!
//! What stays here is the part that is genuinely local:
//!
//! - **[`Domain`]**, this service's own set of MAC purposes. It is an
//!   enum rather than a bare string so every call site stays
//!   exhaustively checked by the compiler; the shared crate takes a
//!   `&str` because the set differs per service and an enum there would
//!   have to know all of them.
//! - **The process key set**, loaded once from this service's own
//!   environment variables.
//!
//! ## Absent key
//!
//! No key configured means **no MAC is written**, and rows carrying one
//! are reported as *unverifiable* rather than as mismatches. This
//! matches how the digests treat rows that predate them: adopting the
//! control must not produce a wall of false accusations, and "I cannot
//! check this" is a different statement from "this is wrong". Both are
//! reported; neither is silently rounded to "verified".
